## So you'd like to help with translating Moodle?

Great! :-) All translation happens on our **[Moodle translation site](http://lang.moodle.org)**, so you'll need to start by creating an account there.

Perhaps you've found some words or phrases not yet translated into your language? Or you've spotted a mistake? If so, please see the guide to [Contributing a translation](./translation/contributing).

:::note

If you'd like to help translate more than just a few strings, please contact the maintainer of your language pack as listed in the [Translation credits](http://lang.moodle.org/local/amos/credits.php) and ask where you can help.

## Wish to take on responsibility for a language pack?

## Is Moodle not yet translated into your language?

Please see  [Starting a new language pack](./translation/langpack).

## Any questions?

Please check the [Translation  FAQ](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Translation__FAQ) and join us in the [Using AMOS forum](http://lang.moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=5).
