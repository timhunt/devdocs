You can consider this page as a list to check before you submit a patch for inclusion into Moodle.

## Split your work into a logical set of patches

Keep in mind that your commits will be reviewed before they are accepted. If the patch does one clear thing and does it well, the review process is fun. Git allows you to prepare patches on your branch into a sequence of logical steps. For example, when changing some API, divide the change into two steps. In the first commit, change the API. In the following commit, change all places that use the API. <tt>git rebase -i</tt> is one of the commands you can use to do this.

## Provide clear commit messages

Consider the commit message as an email for the developer who would explore the change in the future. We recommend to follow common Git guidelines for formatting. The first line of commit message is generally treated as commit subject and should not exceed 72 characters. Include the MDL issue number and the area/component at the beginning of the subject line. Please note that 'code area' refers to the code areas being affected by this commit - correct the MDL's components reported against if needed. If you are writing more than one line, the second line must be empty. All the lines should though wrap at the 72nd mark. We can only hardly follow the [50/72 rule](https://www.google.com/?q=git%2050/72%20rule) in Moodle given the extra information expected at first (subject) line.

<ValidExample>

```title="A model commit comment"
MDL-xxxxx code area: short description of the patch

The subject line is followed by an empty line and then a paragraph or two of
a longer description follows if necessary. This longer description is useful
for issues with longer history of comments in the linked MDL so that it
summarizes the patch without the need to go through the whole discussion.

Obviously, avoid messages like "as agreed in the chat" as they will become
useless after a relatively short time.
```

</ValidExample>

Most of Git tools are optimised for this format and they can display the log of commits best then.

::Tip: the command <tt>git log --no-merges</tt> will show you recent commit messages. Hopefully those are all good examples to copy.

## Names in the commit message

Retain the authorship of the patch. If the patch was submitted by someone else - for example a community member who published it in the tracker or in a forum - use the --author parameter. Make sure that your *real* name and contact email are recorded in patch. We use real names written in capital letters like "John Smith". Please do not use names like "john smith", "John S" or "johnny7887". If you use --author parameter, apply the same rules for the name of the author. See almost any Git tutorial on how to set your name and email in the global Git configuration.

### Creating a commit with multiple authors

If your work is the result of collaborative work, you can use the [github convention](https://docs.github.com/en/github/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors) to credit other authors.

Rebase all the commits into a single commit, and add the mention *Co-authored-by: Firstname Lastname &lt;email>* at the end of the commit message. You must credit only one author per line. You don't need to add yourself in the commit message.

e.g. https://github.com/moodle/moodle/commit/fbb219617b5

## Provide clear and operational instructions to test your patch

In the tracker issue, please describe how the change can be tested. Please avoid vague phrases like "Make sure there is no regression in the core" or "Test all places where XXX is used". Also, try to avoid requiring resources that are really difficult to gather, if possible - as in "Use production data from a server with 100.000+ students".

If you have permission, edit the tracker issue and put the testing instructions into the "Testing instructions" field. If you do not have permission to edit that field, then write them in a comment on the tracker issue.

It helps if you state your estimation of the testing difficulty so that testers can pick issues for them:

;Easy : (average community member should be able to test it) - can be tested pretty easily via the web interface only at a public test site
;Moderate : (knowledgeable administrator should be able to test it) - requires local installation, for example to test some 1.9 -> 2.0 upgrade steps or some non-standard environment (for example MNet features, specific platform etc)
;Hard : (development skills are required to test it) - for example may require data hacking at SQL level to simulate data corruption or modifying the code to reproduce the problem

Example testing instructions:

<ValidExample>
(difficulty: easy, requires teacher access to a course)
1. Log in as a teacher and go to a course
2. Turn editing mode on
3. TEST: Make sure that the control icons appear next to the activity titles
4. Turn editing mode off
5. TEST: Make sure that the control icons are not displayed now
</ValidExample>

## Introducing new strings

Firstly, think twice and try to think in a non-English language. Any string you introduce is supposed to be translated by translators who usually do it for free in their own time. Do not waste their time by using get_string() for debugging messages that are likely to almost never appear. It is warmly recommended to let Helen review your strings before you submit them. This way we can keep the terminology and the style consistent. When introducing new strings, keep them alphabetically sorted. Using a self-descriptive names of the string identifier and the placeholder properties helps the translators to guess the context. Compare the following

```php
$string['grade'] = 'Grade {$a}';
```

with

```php
$string['maxgradevalue'] = 'Grade {$a->value}';
```

In the first case, it is pretty difficult to guess whether the "Grade" in the string is a noun (as in "Grade 12/30") or a verb (as in "Grade submission"). In many languages, the translation depends on it. The second case is more self-descriptive as it indicates that the placeholder will contain a value.

Another good example of how _not_ to name string identifiers would be something like

```php
$string['post'] = 'Post';
```

Note that there is no clue if the "post" here is used as a noun (e.g. describing one particular forum post) or a verb (such as an action of posting into a forum). In many languages, the translation is different for either case.

See [Help strings](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Help_strings) if you are introducing a new help string.

## Include AMOS script in the commit if needed

If you change the identifier of a string or split a string into two forks, provide a script for AMOS in the commit message. Since Moodle 2.0, the translations are kept on separated branches again. The AMOS plugin at http://lang.moodle.org tracks the changes in string files and automatically records modifications, additions and removals of strings. Therefore strings can be re-worded freely on stable branches and should be removed from the master branch if they are not needed any more (do not remove strings from stable branches).

If you change the identifier of the string (that is the key in the $string array), move the string from one file to another or you are introducing a new string as a copy of some current one, you should provide instructions for AMOS so that the action can be applied in all language packs. That will save valuable translators' time. Instructions for AMOS are being put into the commit message of a commit that modifies the original English string files. The commit message containing such a script may look like this:

<ValidExample>

```
MDL-xxxxx code area: short description of the patch

It is recommended to leave a blank line between the commit message and the
script block.

AMOS BEGIN
 MOV [configfoobar,core_admin],[foobar_desc,core_admin]
 CPY [submission,mod_assignment],[submission,mod_workshop]
AMOS END
```

</ValidExample>

See [Automated Manipulation of Strings 2.0#AMOS script](../../projects/api/amos.md#amos-script) for more details of the syntax. See [the log history](http://git.moodle.org/gw?p=moodle.git&a=search&h=HEAD&st=commit&s=AMOS+BEGIN) real examples of usage.

## Removing strings

When a new feature completely replaces an existing feature, any strings which are no longer used should be removed from the code in the master branch. See [String deprecation](../../projects/api/string-deprecation.md) for more information.

## Main version changes

If your commit requires a change to the main version number in version.php (and corresponding upgrade in lib/db/upgrade.php), you should increment that version number by .01, and let integrators deal with merge conflicts (for example if multiple people that week submit several .01 updates).

(Note there may be policies about avoiding the type of changes which require version.php updates, especially in stable branches.)
